Computer graphics enable the creation of 3D models of real or imaginary objects, and my project showcases a “3D Car Animation” built using OpenGL in Code Blocks. This project features various interactive functions: a car model mode displaying a 3D car moving in different directions, and a car driving mode allowing the car to move forward and backward. Additionally, we have implemented a wheel effect where the 3D car's wheels rotate realistically as it moves. Users can also change the car's color, choosing from red, blue, green, black, yellow, and grey. The project includes both day and night modes to enhance the realism and visual appeal. Through this project, users can interact with the 3D car in multiple ways, providing an engaging and educational experience in computer graphics and animation.
Through the utilization of powerful OpenGL functions, this project delivers realistic visuals and captivating effects. The car model is rendered with attention to detail, including realistic movements and lighting effects. The car's movements, such as driving forward and backward and rotating wheels, are depicted convincingly, enhancing the overall experience. By incorporating interactivity and user control, "3D Car Animation" provides an educational and entertaining simulation of a car's functionalities, including changing car colors and switching between day and night modes. This project enthralls users with its immersive and aesthetically pleasing representation, providing a compelling and interactive experience in digital visualization. 
We have also implemented the toggle light function that enhances the brightness of the light intensity in the day mode as well as in the night mode to make the view very interactive and attractive to the user
