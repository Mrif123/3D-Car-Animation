🚗 3D Car Animation using OpenGL

🎨 Project Overview

Computer graphics enable the creation of 3D models of real or imaginary objects, and this project showcases a 3D Car Animation built using OpenGL in Code Blocks.

This project offers various interactive functions:

🚘 Car Model Mode: Displays a 3D car moving in different directions.

🛣️ Car Driving Mode: Allows the car to move forward and backward.

🎡 Wheel Rotation: The wheels rotate realistically as the car moves.

🎨 Color Customization: Change the car's color to red, blue, green, black, yellow, or grey.

🌞🌙 Day & Night Modes: Enhance realism with different lighting effects.

💡 Toggle Light Function: Adjust the brightness intensity in both day and night modes.

Through the use of powerful OpenGL functions, this project delivers realistic visuals and captivating effects, making it an engaging experience for users interested in computer graphics and animation.
